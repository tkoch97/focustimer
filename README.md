## Focus Timer ⏱


![preview](/github/preview.png)


> In this project I created a focus timer page, based on the pomodoro focus method. It starts with 25 minutes on the timer (by default), but the user can change the minutes by clicking on the timer icon. Pause and stop buttons exist too, as well as two buttons that let you play or mute background music.

> This project was done as an exercise proposed by Rocketseat's Explorer course.
